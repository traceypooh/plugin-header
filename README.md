# plugin-header
Simple WordPress plugin that allows you to take over the header part of a page and still work with *other* normal WP themes/plugins (coexists!)

I'm doing something *just* like this on my website, http://poohBot.com, using an alternate header piece I made called "slide-responsively" http://poohbot.com/2015/05/06/slide-responsively-minimal-standalone-htmcssjs-inspired-by-sliding-door-from-wayne-connor/
 
 Just git clone this into your "wp-content/plugins/" folder
 then go to your dashboard, find the plugins area, and activate the plugin to try

LIBERATE your WordPress!
Take back your header!   8-D
