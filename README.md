# plugin-header
simple WordPress plugin that allows you to take over the header part of a page and still work with *other* themes/plugins

I'm doing something *just* like this on my website, http://poohBot.com, using an alternate header piece I made called "slide-responsively" http://poohbot.com/2015/05/06/slide-responsively-minimal-standalone-htmcssjs-inspired-by-sliding-door-from-wayne-connor/
